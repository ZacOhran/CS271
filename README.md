# CS271


Assignment One:
Interesting Topics: AI: Both Specific and General are even more interesting since i last did this assignment. GTP-4 and ChatGTP are crazy cool and I use them daily. Dall E and Midjourney are gettng crazy cool as well.
Sound recognition: I have an Alexa and I have no idea how it works.
Image recognition: With learning about AI and Dall E specifically, I have learned a bit what Image Recognition is, but it is still a mystery to me.
Video Game servers: Currently looking into serer side stuff and it's pretty interesting. Makes sense why lag is a thing. Systems have to be huge 
Algorithems: Know nothing about it but the word has always seemed cool.

Difficult:
Memory stuff: Worst part of C was learning memory allocation. Still don't understand it.
Binary sounds terrible to code in, and similarly assembly language. It sounds like C or some other basic buildable-on language.
Logic Gates for some reason make no sense either
